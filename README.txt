1. In Driver part, commented part is for puzzle size,start position and goal position changing, the order is usd same as example give in project description.

2.Although I putted all 7 searches together in fixed size 11-d of Driver, but there is a bug with outputting the file,
which is when 2 searches simultaneously run, it will have duplicated records. Therefore, please test them one by one, and comment other else.

3.Depth limit has to be updated manually in class DFS line 18, and run it.
